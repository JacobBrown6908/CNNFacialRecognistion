st.write(
    "This is a complex facial recognition application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify different faces, "
    "using a database of images of the same person with multiple different angles, emotions, and facial expressions throughout their lifetime. "
    "This is a great tool for security and law enforcement to identify people in a crowd or within a large database of images. "
    "It can also be used with cameras on smart devices to increase security and privacy when accessing confidential information."
